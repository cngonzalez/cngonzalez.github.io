title: Kernel, getting mixed-in, and hidden objects in general
---
During [that same traumatic lab](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development/rails/refactoring-with-helpers-and-model-methods/model-class-methods-lab) Unmi brought up yesterday, I was trying to figure out if there was a SEPARATE ARel object that I had to talk to, in addition to my ActiveRecord table (there wasn't. I was losing my mind)


So I wanted to see all of the objects that were available to me, which is when I found out about ObjectSpace.each_object, which allowed me to iterate over all objects in my environment. There were a ton, and it was completely useless. But writing "instance_variables" into my Pry console helped give me a cleaner look at what was going on. And "global_variables" was just mystifying:

```
[:$;, :$-F, :$@, :$!, :$SAFE, :$~, :$&, :$\`, :$', :$+, :$=, :$KCODE, :$-K, :$,, :$/, :$-0, :$\, :$\_, :$stdin, :$stdout, :$stderr, :$>, :$<, :$., :$FILENAME, :$-i, :$\*, :$:, :$-I, :$LOAD_PATH, :$", :$LOADED_FEATURES, :$?, :$$, :$VERBOSE, :$-v, :$-w, :$-W, :$DEBUG, :$-d, :$0, :$PROGRAM_NAME, :$-p, :$-l, :$-a, :$fileutils_rb_have_lchmod, :$fileutils_rb_have_lchown, :$CGI_ENV, :$\_rspec_core_load_started_at, :$jruby_version, :$CODERAY_DEBUG, :$DEBUG_BEFORE, :$1, :$2, :$3, :$4, :$5, :$6, :$7, :$8, :$9]
```


Some of these are familiar (hi, "\_") and some are alien ("fileutils_rb_have_lchmod"?) but they mostly seem designed to keep everything running smoothly and in a common language. But I have better ways of finding that out! So I called .inspect on one of them...


```
13] pry(Captain)> $LOADED_FEATURES.inspect
=> "[\"enumerator.so\", \"rational.so\", \"complex.so\", \"encdb.so\", \"trans/transdb.so\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/unicode_normalize.rb\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/x86_64-darwin14/rbconfig.rb\", \"thread.rb\", \"thread.so\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/compatibility.rb\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/defaults.rb\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/deprecate.rb\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/errors.rb\", \"/Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/version.rb\"...
```


Okay, that one should have been a no-brainer. It's also not particularly helpful. So what if I ask it what its methods are? Well, there are a lot, but none of them are particularly interesting. You see a lot of the same ones over and over again:


```
<=>,
 :class,
 :clone,
 :dup,
 :itself,
 :tainted?,
 :untaint,
 :untrust,
 :trust,
 :each_with_index,
 :each_with_object,
 :chunk,
 :slice_before,
 :lazy,
```


So I investigated further, and a pattern started to emerge...


```
[6] pry(Captain)> method(:capture).owner
=> Kernel
[7] pry(Captain)> method(:method).owner
=> Kernel
```

...What. I tried this in IRB for good measure, with a method everyone knows and loves.

```
2.2.3 :002 > method(:puts).owner
 => Kernel

```


At this point, I felt confident thinking that something called Kernel was just whatever ran in the background as the main object in every Ruby program, and, because it took in and put out information, it must be an IO object. I even said this during a standup. Then, later that day, I decided to look a little more closely, and discovered I was completely wrong.



```
2.2.3 :003 > method(:puts).receiver
 => main
 2.2.3 :004 > self
 => main
2.2.3 :005 > self.class
 => Object
 2.2.3 :009 > Object.ancestors
 => [Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
2.2.3 :006 > Kernel.class
  => Module
```


Okay... This was getting confusing. The main environment was just an object, but all of its methods was coming from Kernel. Kernel, it turns out, isn't an object the way I thought it was at all! I mean, everything is an object in Ruby, but Kernel is just a module that gets mixed-in to the Object class.

(When I say that Kernel methods are mixed-in, I mean that the Object class is including the Kernel module. You can confirm this by looking at the [Ruby source code](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/object.c):


```
rb_mKernel = rb_define_module("Kernel");
   rb_include_module(rb_cObject, rb_mKernel);
```


So if Kernel just gives Object all its methods, this should work, right?



```
 2.2.3 :010 > Kernel.puts("Whatever")
Whatever
 => nil
 2.2.3 :011 > obj = Object.new
 => #<Object:0x007f93521c36e8>
2.2.3 :012 > obj.puts("whatever")
NoMethodError: private method `puts' called for #<Object:0x007f93521c36e8>
	from (irb):12
	from /Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/irb:15:in `<main>'

```


But I thought Kernel gave me all its methods! Except, no, no it doesn't.


```

2.2.3 :018 > class Test
2.2.3 :019?>   puts "Hi"
2.2.3 :020?>   puts self
2.2.3 :021?>   end
Hi
Test
 => nil
2.2.3 :022 > Test.puts("Hi")
NoMethodError: private method `puts' called for Test:Class
	from (irb):22
	from /Users/Carolina/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin/irb:15:in `<main>'
2.2.3 :023 > def test_me
2.2.3 :024?>   puts "Hi"
2.2.3 :025?>   puts self
2.2.3 :026?>   end
 => :test_me
2.2.3 :027 > Kernel.private_method_defined?(:puts)
 => true
 2.2.3 :029 > Method.ancestors
 => [Method, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
 2.2.3 :031 > Class.ancestors
 => [Class, Module, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

```

Puts is a private method (thanks Margaret!) that's called in implicitly on whatever self is. And self changes from circumstance to circumstance. When I have a puts inside a class or a method, it's the actually the class or method calling puts on itself, since every class and method inherits from Object, with the Kernel methods mixed-in.


So that thing I said that was wrong, that there's some magical IO object that inputs and outputs from an environment? I checked for it in Pry again.


```
pry(Captain)> ObjectSpace.each_object(IO){|x| p x}

=> 16
```


Everything was closed! Including the file I was currently in! Including my Pry history! (Closed, I found out, just means the file isn't currently open for editing, and isn't currently being written -- it works a lot like the HTTP class, actually). All my IO objects were closed except for three things:


```
#<IO:<STDERR>>
#<IO:<STDOUT>>
#<IO:<STDIN>>
```


All of which, if you check, have the Kernel methods attached to them. And that's because....


```
pry(Captain)> IO.ancestors
=> [IO,
 File::Constants,
 Enumerable,
 Object,
 ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable,
 PP::ObjectMixin,
 JSON::Ext::Generator::GeneratorMethods::Object,
 Kernel,
 BasicObject]

```

Well, so I was only kind of wrong.
